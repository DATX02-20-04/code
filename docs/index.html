<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org27ab1f0">
<p>
Due to our audio results not being good enough, we experimented with a deeper
model with more convolution layers. This ended up not being that easy to train,
and had trouble learning anything at all.
</p>

<p>
The shallow model used last week had a lot of trouble with classifying pitches.
The primary reason we think is the resolution begin too smaller. To demonstrate
this, we have increased the resolution of spectrograms to \(128 \times 256\), ie
double the number of frequency &rsquo;bins&rsquo;.
</p>


<div id="org0a3d8f1" class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/high_res_pitch.png" alt="high_res_pitch.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>A mel spectrogram of every pitch available in the gansynth dataset. These are generated pitches from training our shallow model, so they are not perfect but they demonstrate how resolution matters. The label number indicates MIDI pitch. Note how a higher pitch decreases space between overtones.</p>
</div>

<p>
The spectrograms in figure <a href="#org0a3d8f1">1</a> are generated using our shallow
model and the higher resolution. As we have already explained, the horizontal
lines are overtones. Between a tone and an overtone, there is a finite amount of
space that has to be large enough for 11 other notes, those being the other
musical notes (12 tones in total).A larger resolution ensures these 11 notes fit
into the spectrogram bins, which is vital for the auxiliary classifier to
recognise them.
</p>

<p>
The second, somewhat larger issue is that the space between overtones change
depending on the pitch of note. The nth overtone frequency is calculated as
\[f_{n} = n \times f_{0}\] where \(f_{0}\) is the base frequency of the note (or
pitch). As such, a very low pitch has very little space between the overtones
than a high note. Even though the spectrogram uses logarithmic scale on the
y-axis, it only counteracts this so that large pitches stay within small images.
It does not expand already low frequencies. The generated examples in
<a href="#org0a3d8f1">1</a> demonstrate this by failing completely to generate very low
frequency notes.
</p>

<p>
A third issue form these results are that some single pitches also fail to
generate. Our theory is that some pitches fall into the same bin, causing the
classifier to have to pick between two images that look like they have the same
pitch, but don&rsquo;t. A higher resolution should also solve this if that is the
case.
</p>

<p>
For our \(128 \times 128\), the classifier the generator was never able to
generate the correct pitches, never deceasing its loss. For the above
\(128 \times 256\), it can somehow manage, but not enough. At the time of writing,
this model has trained for 107k steps, reaching great sounding results for some
of the notes much faster than any other attempt. Here are some examples sampled
from the middle of the pitch interval.
</p>

 <audio controls="controls" src="audio/sample_pitches.wav"></audio>
</p>

</div>

<p>
Of course, they don&rsquo;t sound perfect yet at such low period of training, but they
demonstrate pitch classification and a somewhat good piano sound. Next thing to
try is another step higher in resolution.

We had to cancel both the supervisor meeting and the Friday meeting with our
group that we hold each week, so this week may not correctly reflect all
progress that have happened in the project. I (Christoffer) try to sum
everything up but it will always focus more on what I&rsquo;ve been doing due to me
writing the log. Please refer to the time log for more specific work by other members.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org00ad4d4">
<p>
We are currently working hard on getting pitch conditioning to work since that
is the bottleneck for connecting with structure. To accomplish this, we are
constantly reading about ways of conditioning GANs, one of which is using an
<i>auxiliary classifier</i>.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="orgafc6320">Pitch conditioning and Auxiliary Classifier</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgafc6320">
<p>
As explained last week, we require this step to be able to choose which notes
are being played. However, from our research and from limited testing, we found
that the generator rarely if ever made use of the additional pitch information.
To encourage the generator to actually use it, we implement an auxiliary
classifier loss to the network.
</p>

</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3: </span>Overview of how a Auxiliary Classifier GAN works (ACGAN)</p>
</div>

<p>
The <i>ACGAN</i> in figure <a href="#org7f74c78">3</a> shows pitch class as \(c\), noise input as \(z\),
and the real image as x (which also needs a pitch class)
</p>

<p>
Without explaining exactly how a GAN works, there are two networks, a generator
and a discriminator. The aux classifier comes in at the discriminator, who
normally only has the job of determining fake vs real images from its input
(either an image from the dataset or form the generator). With an aux
classifier, there is a second loss, depending on if the discriminator can
correctly label the pitch of the generated image.
</p>

<p>
The discriminators \(D\) job is then to maximise \[L_{D} = L_{C} + L_{S}\] where
\(L_{C}\) is the log-likelihood of correct class (or pitch in this case), and
\(L_{S}\) is the log-likelihood of correct source (real vs fake image).
</p>

<p>
The generators \(G\) job is then to maximise \[L_{G} = L_{C} - L_{S}\] or in
words, get D to determine the class label right, but fail at determining real vs
fake.
</p>

<p>
With an actual loss to the discriminator and generator, the hope is they won&rsquo;t
ignore the pitch vectors anymore. We have almost implemented all this, but are
still experimenting with getting it entirely correct.

<h4 id="org80aaed9">Training</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org80aaed9">
<p>
Our required time to train has gone up drastically. For example, the pitch
conditioning with an auxiliary classifier (but probably without one as well)
required 2.5 days to train. That is around 1.5M steps. We may have been able
to decrease this but that is still a lot of time spent on waiting for results
that may or may not be great. This is after we decreased each epoch (~200 steps)
from 40 seconds to 11 seconds by caching all images from the dataset into memory.

Figures <a href="#org62f7970">4</a> and <a href="#orgc97b0a7">5</a> shows that it does reach an
equilibrium, which is where the training is optimal. It does reach this stage,
but determining when to stop is a difficult thing. Another issue that arises
with longer training periods is over-fitting on the dataset, which is not idea
either. The skips in the figure are due to us requiring to stop the training to
use the GPUs to generate results.

<p>
The following results were taken from the above training session at the last
skip and at the end. (steps 600K and 1600K). The pitches used are increasing,
but due to a bug in our code, the spectrograms are flipped on the y axis (as the
plot suggests). Here, we use an embedding of the pitch label instead of a one-hot
encoding.

<p>
The main issue in this seems to be mode collapse, the generator no matter pitch
or noise input generates the same or similar examples. In the case of figure
<a href="#orgcde267b">7</a>, there are three kinds of images, of which only one of them
resembles a keyboard (which is what we are training on). Arguably, you could
have noticed mode collapse in figure <a href="#org0d4647f">6</a>, but we thought we would
give it a try anyway.
</p>

<p>
The next experiment we ran was a deeper network with much more trainable
parameters. We trained it overnight on only acoustic keyboard sounds from the
GANSynth subset of NSynth.

Figures <a href="#orgb671739">8</a> and <a href="#org467d1ae">9</a> show an unstable network
Ideally, they converge to the Nash equilibrium and stay around there. Due to
this issue and that the deeper model requires more time to train to see
improvement, we reverted back to our previous, shallower networks.
</p>

<p>
Next experiment was using one-hot encoding of pitch with a shallower network
(quicker to train). We also multiplied the aux component of the losses by a
weight of 10, hoping it would prioritise decreasing that penalty. For this
experiment, we also added logging images in tensorboard so we didn&rsquo;t have to
stop training while seeing model progress.

<p>
The loss graphs in figures <a href="#org4a8d924">10</a> and <a href="#orge2bf820">11</a> look
much better than before. Not visualised in them is that the discriminator starts
from ~10, while the generator stars from ~40. This is because of the weighted
aux loss described earlier. Figure <a href="#org509ffcf">12</a> shows to us almost
random noise but at this point almost all loss from the aux is eliminated. At
around step ~40K the generator starts generating images that resembles
spectrograms, shown in figure <a href="#orgcbc8b5f">13</a>. Figure <a href="#orgd576bbc">14</a>
shows accurate spectrograms representations.
</p>

<p>
Although we have generated pitches in increasing fashion for these figures, the
generator does not map them in that fashion. To show that pitch conditioning
does indeed work, we provide the generator different noise inputs \(z\) but the same
pitch classes \(c\).

<p>
 <audio controls="controls" src="audio/same_pitch_spec.wav"></audio>
</p>

</div>

<p>
Note that while figure <a href="#org3e38431">15</a> may look like mode collapse just like
before, they look similar due to us choosing to generate only a specific pitch.
The horizontal lines that make up the note are similar due to this, but timbre
which is represented by everything else in the image differs.
</p>

<p>
With this, we can select which pitch to generate, but not reliably. Our use case
requires us to be able to select for instance the note A, but here we have no
idea which one-hot vector represents that. Why it didn&rsquo;t learn them in order, we
don&rsquo;t know. But solving this problem will be our next priority.
</p>

<p>
Also, some processing was wrong with this generation that affects how
normalising spectrograms work. Normalising is not a simple operation, and
depends on the datasets standard deviation and variance. This requires us to
process the entire dataset before training to calculate these. Because we
switched to only guitars, the old one calculated is not correct, and we forgot
to recalculate it.
</p>

<p>
This variant will continue training until we are sure it won&rsquo;t improve more, but
for now, these are the results we have.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7577d2d">
<p>
We have made good progress on the report, though we feel that since our
implementation is so advanced compared to the typical bachelor thesis, the
theory section has to be really large. As such, we have primarily been writing
theory and a bit on implementation.
</p>

<p>
We came up with a good structure with our supervisor and are right now focusing
on making each chapter have roughly the same amount of pages. We could easily
write too much for this report, so we have to find a balance of what is actually
required to explain to understand the implementation. An example is: how do you
explain how a transformer with attention work? This topic could easily take ~20
pages but leaving it too short would make understanding difficult for the reader
who we target as our course mates.

<div id="outline-container-orgd6db44f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd6db44f">Note generation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd6db44f">
<p>
In order to connect this component to the final system, we need to condition it
on pitch so we can controlling which pitch/note the generator generates. This is
what we have been working on this week. The main idea is to append a one-hot
vector representation of notes (size of 88 which are the number of keys on a
standard piano or number of tones in MIDI). The hope is that the generator then
learns to generate random sounding tones according to that vector.
</p>

<p>
Pitch conditioning is almost done but we cannot be sure it is entirely right.
We may have to add another loss component to the discriminator called an
<i>auxiliary classifier</i> that would encourage the generator to care more about the
conditioning vector.
</p>

<p>
This idea came from the GANSynth paper. They do a lot of other things as well,
including adding a phase channel to the network, allowing it to generate its own
phase instead of having to reconstruct it using the Griffin-lim algorithm. They
call this Instantaneous Frequency, which is the derivative of phase. We also
want to implement this because even though our processing and inversion sounds
&ldquo;good enough&rdquo;, this could improve it.
</p>

<p>
Due to limited training, we do not have a lot of great sounding examples yet so
but hopefully we will have some by next week.

 <audio controls="controls" src="audio/our_inverted_specs_fixed.wav"></audio>
</p>

<p>
They do not sound that good but some tonality is there. We think there may be a
problem with the inversion back into audio. To demonstrate this, the following
audio snippet is from real notes inverted into spectrograms and then back with
the same data pipeline:
</p>

<p>
 <audio controls="controls" src="audio/actual_inverted_spec_fixed.wav"></audio>
</p>

<p>
There are similar results indicating that there is an issue. Whether this is
due to errors in spectrogram generation or from inverting back, we have not
concluded yet.
</p>

<p>
A real inversion (with all parameters set properly) will not sound perfect due
to processing audio into a spectrogram throws away the phase information of the
signal. There are algorithms for rebuilding this (Griffith-lim) but they are not
perfect. Early tests in the project showed that the quality is good enough, much
better than the results we get now.

<h4 id="org531e224">Structure Generation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org531e224">
<p>
Last week, the results sounded quite good. That is because the prior was very
long, the model ended up copying too much resulting in an existing song (with
some minor alterations). We think it may be due to overfitting on the dataset
(MAESTRO). The following audio snippet was generated with a smaller prior:
</p>

<p>
 <audio controls="controls" src="audio/mutrans_half_prior_half_gen.wav"></audio>
</p>

<p>
We believe the MIDI encoding is fine (good enough) since encoding and decoding a
real song gives good results (besides it not being lossless).

<h4 id="orge17e8f2">Transformer</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge17e8f2">
<p>
The transformer aims to deal with the structure of music. It trains on MIDI,
learning the relationships between sequences of MIDI notes and outputs the most
appropriate notes. The aim of this model is to connect it with the note
generation to generate complete music.
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ve been working towards getting the music transformer model running and also
implementing our own version of it. This week, we managed to run both and
generate results. Below are the audio snippets of the two.
</p>

<p>
All we&rsquo;ve done on specGAN this week is to setup training environment and
check pointing so that we can train it for a longer period of time.
</p>

<p>
Below are some results of training the model on all kinds of guitar sounds
in the NSynth dataset. Note that this set includes both acoustic and
electric guitar, which sound very different.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="Week%207/result_2020-03-06_12-41-39.gif" alt="result_2020-03-06_12-41-39.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is a GIF of the training from epoch 0 to epoch ~140. Not much to say other than it looks decent.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="Week%207/image_2020-03-06_12-43-03.png" alt="image_2020-03-06_12-43-03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This image show a longer training period, epoch ~640 of a different seed. As you
can see, the spectrograms here resemble the real ones calculated in week 5. I
realised I haven&rsquo;t explained how a spectrogram works:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>X axis is the sample (time in discrete sense)</li>
<li>Y is the frequency, or tone if you will</li>
<li>Color is the magnitude of the short-term Fourier transform</li>
</ul>

<p>
The straight horizontal lines indicate a frequency or note was played for a long
time. The reason for many horizontal lines are overtones of the note. These
overtones should be evenly spaced, if we are trying to simulate a note from an
instrument. As you can see, the model has far to go in that regard.
</p>

<p>
Also note the purple part to the right. The sound samples are 4 seconds long,
with 64000 samples each but almost all sounds cut out at around 3.2s. That is
way the purple area exists in each spectrogram.
</p>

<p>
I should also mention that this is trained on the valid set of NSynth, meaning
instead of ~280k samples that the training set has, we are only working with
~12k. This is very bad, but the reason has to do with us not being able to load
in the larger dataset into colab due to some bug that is extremely hard to
troubleshoot. (Input/output error if you are curious). There is very little info
online so either we try solving it on our own (no good error log of it) or we
use other training resources.
</p>

<p>
We also have to work on inverting this; there are a lot of parameters that need
to be specified for this inversion to be done correctly and sound okay.

<p>
While SpecGan is good at generating notes, it is not easy to convert an existing note to a latent vector which can be fed to the generator.  This would be useful if we want to train a network to generate melodies as a sequence of latent space vectors.
</p>

<p>
The solution proposed here is to make a hybrid of variational autoencoders and gans, such that crisp images can still be generated, but it also becomes possible to encode them.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to first train a variational autoencoder, and then train a gan to generate realistic images when given the encoding and some noise as input.
In order to ensure that the generated images look similar to the input, the GAN generated image is also encoded, and the generator
gets an additional loss that ensures that the new encoding is similar to the encoding of the original image.

In the transformer regard, we are working on getting the MIDI pipeline done
so that we can train the transformers on midi data. The dataset for this is
MAESTRO, which includes both raw audio and MIDI of recordings.
</p>

<p>
MIDI is great at structure, and the goal of the transformers are to get long
term structure. Further ahead in the project, we want to combine note
generation with structure of transformers to hopefully generate music with
details of raw audio and structure of MIDI.
</p>

<p>
So far, there&rsquo;s a lot of research about transformers and how other models
have encoded MIDI for use with machine learning.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org128e632">
<p>
<b>Too ambitions</b>: The project is very ambitious. The workflow of starting on
simple tasks (generating a note etc) and building on those with sprints
remedies that somewhat. Still, we want to spend some time exactly defining
what the end product will be.
</p>

<p>
<b>Better planning</b>: We&rsquo;ve realised we need a better system for distributing
tasks to the members. Right now you could easily not know what to work. Our
idea is to use Trello for this, but that requires setup and splitting tasks
into even smaller tasks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Resources</b>: We need better resources for training. We&rsquo;ve started asking about
these things. Hopefully we will get an answer next week.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Christoffer: Mostly worked on plan and the specGAN model. Also started a
bit on final report and helped with presentation. Also been handling
communication with examiner and sent mails about computing resources</li>
<li>Eric: I started with training an existing model called WaveRNN where I
managed to generate something that sounds like a flute note. I did the
training on my personal computer at home which is not optimal. We need
better computing resources. I then went on to try a model called MelNet,
which is similar to WaveRNN but it uses melspectograms instead of waveforms
which might be more promising.</li>
<li>Carl: Some work on report; successfully training a WaveNet on sine and
square waves</li>
<li>Lovisa: Project plan work, as well as some on the specGAN</li>
<li>Cao: Worked on the presentation, reading about GANSynth, trying out
different discriminator/ generator for the simple GAN model that I
implemented last week.</li>
<li>Elias: Spent the first half of the week rewriting the project plan.
Afterwards I primarily worked on getting a 1d convolutional autoencoder
working. I kind of succeeded, but it is very computationally heavy at the
moment and the loss doesn’t really decrease. The output is just noise so
far.</li>

We spent this week working on implementing two kinds of models:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>WaveNet - a raw audio generative model mainly used for speech synthesis</li>
<li>SpecGAN - a model using generative adversarial networks for training by converting audio into spectrographs.</li>

The main purpose of this was to generate a note using the NSynth dataset

<h3 id="org870578f">Project plan review</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org870578f">
<p>
After a meeting with our examiner, there were a fair amount of things that
needed to be changed in the plan.
</p>

<p>
Most of the feedback applies to the entire plan, but here are some key points:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Background</b>: Does not explain or motivate the problem well enough. It is meant to capture the reader but our background lacks a lot of passion required for that.</li>
<li><b>Aim</b>: Same here generally, does not explain why this is an important and interesting field.</li>
<li><b>Time plan</b>: Does not tell a story, how will we accomplish these things. Try and detail every week and what happens if we discover hurdles. It also has to detail consistent deliveries, ie if the project suddenly had to stop for whatever reason, what do we have to show for our work?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Deadline for the rewritten plan is Wednesday, <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2020-02-26 Wed&gt; </span></span> at 12:00. We
will also try to send it to our supervisor by Monday/Tuesday.

<h3 id="orgb8e7af2">Project so far</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb8e7af2">
<p>
So far, a lot of work has been going on using colab, a notebook editor in
Google drive. It allows limited access to GPUs which makes it great for
smaller experimentation of models. In the future, we&rsquo;ll want to either pay
for access to GPUs, or try and use Chalmers GPU clusters.

<h4 id="org1b9d561">WaveNet</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1b9d561">
<p>
WaveNet requires the amplitudes to be encoded to something that is easier
for the network to work with. This is done using mu<sub>law</sub> encoding, which is
basically just bucketing the amplitudes, but where is gives mode detail to
small amplitudes than large ones.

<h4 id="org4bc737c">SpecGAN</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4bc737c">
<p>
We were originally going to implement GAN-TTS, but because of its
complexity, we decided to implement something simpler first. As mentioned,
most guides on GANs are for images, so it seemed fitting to start with a
model using images (spectrographs).

<p>
This model requires processing the audio waveform into images using digital
signal processing. This did not have to be done manually, as there are
plenty of libraries to use, but the challenge is to ensure all images of the
entire dataset represent the same thing and have the same format and size.
As such, the data preprocessing has been one of the sub tasks for this.
</p>

<p>
The other task is to implement the actual model. There are many guides on
implementing a GAN using the MNIST dataset (dataset consisting of
handwritten letters in image form), but some slight modifications are
required to suit our needs.

<p>
Apparently the expected work amount up to (and including) week 3 was an average of
72 hours (according to mail sent to supervisor). Unless this is an error, that
would mean 24 hours worked per week on average. The information we received
was that it&rsquo;s expected to work 20 hours a week, but that initially that is
hard to achieve. In case it&rsquo;s not an error, we are aware of it but it doesn&rsquo;t
match information we&rsquo;ve gotten earlier.

<h3 id="org3187012">Regarding project log feedback</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3187012">
<p>
I appreciate the feedback regarding the project log but want to explain something.
So far, most of the work that has been done is either research (paper and
presentation for group), writing contract/plan or minor implementation.
</p>

<p>
I mention this because so far, there&rsquo;s very little to talk about regarding
individual performance here. We could spend a lot of time detailing
everything done, but that is much better done in the time log above. The
point is, up to this point there has been a lot of shared work.
</p>

<p>
Now that the planning stage is over (which is a very shared job), this part
should be easier to write as more individual tasks will be delegated.

<p>
A meeting with Chalmers writing was booked, but since that required two groups
to sign up, the meeting never went through. We will try to book another one,
but since the plan now is delivered, getting feedback for it seems unneccesary.
</p>

<p>
On Wednesday, the first draft was sent to the supervisor, with feedback
presented to the group on Friday morning. The meeting and workshop held on
Friday was primarily spent on refining the plan after the feedback received.
All in all, the group is happy with how the plan turned out considering the
project is very open and at a slightly more advanced level than common for
bachelor theses.

<p>
The project plan is complete. Some initial trial and error has been
performed, though generating anything close to music is far off. According to
the time plan, we are now in the phase of generating a musical note using
machine learning.
</p>

<p>
A issue we currently face seems to be storage space. Datasets take a fair
amount of space, yet have to be loaded when training. We&rsquo;re currently waiting
for a reply regarding using Chalmers computing clusters but other options are
available at a price. The canvas page does not specify whether pricing for
such clusters are included in the 3000kr budget (as they don&rsquo;t fall under
components or software), so that will have to be investigated.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Christoffer: So far been tasked with documentation, project log writing and generally being the secretary. Otherwise been learning TensorFlow</li>
<li>Eric: Took on the challenge of creating a gantt chart, which he completed by
writing his own JavaScript script. Also have been very active in initial
development and testing of ideas using google colab.</li>
<li>Carl: Ensured our latex documents have proper systems for commenting and change requesting, which helped writing the plan immensely.</li>
<li>Lovisa: Contacted AIVA (AI music company) for info on how their product worked but didn&rsquo;t get much back from them. Also went through TensorFlow guides.</li>
<li>Cao: Research autoencoders and attempted implementing and training basic models using Keras and TensorFlow</li>
<li><p>

<h2 id="orga9c779b">Week 3</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga9c779b">
<p>
As per usual, the week began with a meeting on Tuesday followed by a longer
workshop. During the meeting, the members went through what they had worked on
since last Friday. For the most part, that was research on TensorFlow and a
paper published by Spotify creator group.
</p>

<p>
For the workshop, it was decided that the majority of time
would be spent on writing the project plan. Basic outlining was conducted to
ensure everyone was on the same page regarding the content.
</p>

<p>
On Friday, there was a meeting with the supervisor where the group quickly
went through some research notes they had taken from the presentations held
last week. Additionally the focus of this meeting was on the project plan.
There were a fair amount of criticism of the current rough draft.
</p>

<p>
After this meeting, the rest of the day involved a long workshop on writing
the plan according to the criticism received earlier. A lot was changed and
this brought the draft much closer to the final write up.
</p>

<p>
There is still work to be done on the plan. The deadline is next Friday with
the groups&rsquo; deadline being set to Wednesday. Therefore, the next week will
primarily deal with finishing the project plan.

<h3 id="org28ec61c">Problems encountered</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org28ec61c">
<p>
Because the group is not used to writing a research project plan but rather a
product project plan, one of the greatest obstacles have been defining what
will be done. Combined with the wide field, it is difficult to estimate how
much time each task takes.
</p>

<p>
The project task has therefore been simplified a fair bit, but it is still in the
groups ambition to incorporate the more complex features of the project given
that there is available time later on.

<h2 id="orge906ece">Week 2</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge906ece">
<p>
The week began with a meeting on Tuesday, during which a number of points were brought up
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Decide report language and register that on canvas</li>
<li>Began talk about the project report</li>
<li>Discussions on the current write up of the contract</li>
</ul>

<p>
The meeting was immediately followed by a workshop, where how to efficiently
structure out research was determined. we concluded that the
group would divide into subgroups with the intent of each reading and
summarising papers. Machine learning is a wide field, beyond basic concepts,
learning everything will take away too much time from the actual project.
</p>

<p>
After a meeting with the supervisor on Friday, a research meeting was held.
The idea was to take the subgroups determined earlier and have them present
their findings for the group. This process will be evaluated for future
research meetings, but we felt it was a good start. If anything, the primary
goal of them is to spark discussions, which it was very effective at.
</p>

<p>
Because Cao only returned on Thursday, the contract wasn&rsquo;t sent to our
supervisor until Friday evening, after the meeting. The contract is now
considered finished.
</p>

<p>
Though stated in last weeks log that we would begin work on the project plan
this week, small strides were made in that direction. This has a lot to do
with the very open project description. The primary hurdle is to decide on a
goal that is not too easy, but realistic enough to achieve. With such a wide
field and different ways of doing things, we have given that part a bit more time.
</p>

<p>
Next week will be focused on the project plan and another research meeting.

<h2 id="org0cf6d40">Week 1</h2>

<p>
Since this is the first week of the project, the majority of it has been
discussing the project and reading up on research papers. We started the week
by attending the introductory seminars.
</p>

<p>
During the three meetings, we set up a slack group, had our first meeting with the supervisor and
started writing the group contract.
</p>

<p>
Alone, most of us studied research papers. Since some of the members lacked
experience in the field, Elias set up a notebook intended for teaching the
basics.
</p>

<p>
For personal reasons, Cao was absent for part of the week, but this was notified well in advance.
</p>

<p>
For next week, we are looking to finish the group contract, continue
researching and starting work on the project plan
