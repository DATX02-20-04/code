<h4 id="org5a42da7">Report</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5a42da7">
<p>
We have made good progress on the report, though we feel that since our
implementation is so advanced compared to the typical bachelor thesis, the
theory section has to be really large. As such, we have primarily been writing
theory and a bit on implementation.
</p>

<p>
We came up with a good structure with our supervisor and are right now focusing
on making each chapter have roughly the same amount of pages. We could easily
write too much for this report, so we have to find a balance of what is actually
required to explain to understand the implementation. An example is: how do you
explain how a transformer with attention work? This topic could easily take ~20
pages but leaving it too short would make understanding difficult for the reader
who we target as our coursemates.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org03c7b37" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org03c7b37">Note generation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org03c7b37">
<p>
In order to connect this component to the final system, we need to condition it
on pitch so we can controlling which pitch/note the generator generates. This is
what we have been working on this week. The main idea is to append a one-hot
vector representation of notes (size of 88 which are the number of keys on a
standard piano or number of tones in MIDI). The hope is that the generator then
learns to generate random sounding tones according to that vector.
</p>

<p>
Pitch conditioning is almost done but we cannot be sure it is entirely right.
We may have to add another loss component to the discriminator called an
<i>auxillary classifier</i> that would encourage the generator to care more about the
conditioning vector.
</p>

<p>
This idea came from the GANSynth paper. They do a lot of other things as well,
including adding a phase channel to the network, allowing it to generate its own
phase instead of having to reconstruct it using the Griffin-lim algorithm. They
call this Instantaneous Frequency, which is the derivative of phase. We also
want to implement this because even though our processing nad inversion sounds
&ldquo;good enough&rdquo;, this could improve it.
</p>

<p>
Due to limited training, we do not have a lot of great sounding examples yet so
but hopefully we will have some by next week.

<h4 id="orgb45b6a0">Structure generation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb45b6a0">
<p>
Structure generation is since last week pretty much done, maybe we could train
it a bit more but our main concern is fixing note generation so that we can
connect the two.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd689afc" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd689afc">Training</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd689afc">
<p>
We started using Bayes but we are not quite sure if we are using it correctly.
The canvas course page states to ensure there are not more threads running than
designated CPU cores, so the main concern is configuring tensorflow to not spawn
~200 threads.
</p>

<p>
We also set up tensorboard to better log our results. We will most likely start
auto generating our images and audio samples but it&rsquo;s not a priority.

More and more chapters are being handled, specifically the theory parts and
techniques we have used over the course of the project. There is also a complete
structure that makes it easy to add content. We have also been thinking about
how we present our journey in the report, and decided that we would add an

<h4 id="org5293073">Note Generation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5293073">
<p>
We are currently trying to implement a Wasserstein GAN, which should improve the
results of the GAN. Below are some audio files that have been processed back
from spectrograms generated by our model.
</p>

<p>
Generated results after training on the GANSynth dataset (slight changes from the NSynth
dataset) . <b>Warning, these are quite loud!</b>
</p>

<p>
<audio controls="controls" src="audio/our_inverted_specs_fixed.wav"></audio>
</p>

<p>
They do not sound that good but some tonality is there. We think there may be a
problem with the inversion back into audio. To demonstrate this, the following
audio snippet is from real notes inverted into spectrograms and then back with
the same data pipeline:
</p>

<p>
<audio controls="controls" src="audio/actual_inverted_spec_fixed.wav"></audio>
</p>

<p>
There are similiar results indicating that there is an issue. Whether this is
due to errors in spectrogram generation or from inverting back, we have not
concluded yet.
</p>

<p>
A real inversion (with all parameters set properly) will not sound perfect due
to processing audio into a spectrogram throws away the phase information of the
signal. There are algorithms for rebuilding this (Griffith-lim) but they are not
perfect. Early tests in the project showed that the quality is good enough, much
better than the results we get now.

<h4 id="org7ddc4fe">Structure Generation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7ddc4fe">
<p>
Last week, the results sounded quite good. That is because the prior was very
long, the model ended up copying too much resulting in an existing song (with
some minor alterations). We think it may be due to overfitting on the dataset
(MAESTRO). The following audio snippet was generated with a smaller prior:
</p>

<p>
<audio controls="controls" src="audio/mutrans_half_prior_half_gen.wav"></audio>
</p>

<p>
We believe the MIDI encoding is fine (good enough) since encoding and decoding a
real song gives good results (besides it not being lossless).

<h4 id="orgde03326">Transformer</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgde03326">
<p>
The transformer aims to deal with the structure of music. It trains on MIDI,
learning the relationships between sequences of MIDI notes and outputs the most
appropriate notes. The aim of this model is to connect it with the note
generation to generate complete music.
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ve been working towards getting the music transformer model running and also
implementing our own version of it. This week, we managed to run both and
generate results. Below are the audio snippets of the two.
</p>

<p>
<b>Our music transformer with prior</b>

<p>
All we&rsquo;ve done on specGAN this week is to setup training environment and
checkpointing so that we can train it for a longer period of time.
</p>

<p>
Below are some results of training the model on all kinds of guitar sounds
in the NSynth dataset. Note that this set includes both acoustic and
electric guitar, which sound very different.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="Week%207/result_2020-03-06_12-41-39.gif" alt="result_2020-03-06_12-41-39.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is a GIF of the training from epoch 0 to epoch ~140. Not much to say other than it looks decent.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="Week%207/image_2020-03-06_12-43-03.png" alt="image_2020-03-06_12-43-03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This image show a longer training period, epoch ~640 of a different seed. As you
can see, the spectrograms here resemble the real ones calculated in week 5. I
realised I haven&rsquo;t explained how a spectrogram works:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>X axis is the sample (time in discrete sense)</li>
<li>Y is the frequency, or tone if you will</li>
<li>Color is the magnitude of the short-term fourier transform</li>
</ul>

<p>
The straight horizontal lines indicate a frequency or note was played for a long
time. The reason for many horizontal lines are overtones of the note. These
overtones should be evenly spaced, if we are trying to simulate a note from an
instrument. As you can see, the model has far to go in that regard.
</p>

<p>
Also note the purple part to the right. The sound samples are 4 seconds long,
with 64000 samples each but almost all sounds cut out at around 3.2s. That is
way the purple area exists in each spectrogram.
</p>

<p>
I should also mention that this is trained on the valid set of NSynth, meaning
instead of ~280k samples that the training set has, we are only working with
~12k. This is very bad, but the reason has to do with us not being able to load
in the larger dataset into colab due to some bug that is extremely hard to
troubleshoot. (Input/output error if you are curious). There is very little info
online so either we try solving it on our own (no good error log of it) or we
use other training resources.
</p>

<p>
We also have to work on inverting this; there are a lot of parameters that need
to be specified for this inversion to be done correctly and sound okay.

<p>
While SpecGan is good at generating notes, it is not easy to convert an existing note to a latent vector which can be fed to the generator.  This would be useful if we want to train a network to generate melodies as a sequence of latent space vectors.
</p>

<p>
The solution proposed here is to make a hybrid of variational autoencoders and gans, such that crisp images can still be generated, but it also becomes possible to encode them.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to first train a variational autoencoder, and then train a gan to generate realistic images when given the encoding and some noise as input.
In order to ensure that the generated images look similar to the input, the GAN generated image is also encoded, and the generator
gets an additional loss that ensures that the new encoding is similar to the encoding of the original image.

In the transoformer regard, we are working on getting the MIDI pipeline done

MAESTRO, which includes both raw audio and MIDI of recordings.
</p>

<p>
MIDI is great at structure, and the goal of the transformers are to get long
term structure. Further ahead in the project, we want to combine note
generation with structure of transformers to hopefully generate music with
details of raw audio and structure of MIDI.
</p>

<p>
So far, there&rsquo;s a lot of research about transformers and how other models
have encoded MIDI for use with machine learning.

note with overtones but it still needs some work/training.

Unfortuneately, the results from this model look decent, but sound terrible.
It doesn&rsquo;t quite follow the implementation specGAN used, so that is an area we could improve.

<p>
<b>Too ambitions</b>: The project is very ambitious. The workflow of starting on
simple tasks (generating a note etc) and building on those with sprints
remedies that somewhat. Still, we want to spend some time exactly defining
what the end product will be.
</p>

<p>
<b>Better planning</b>: We&rsquo;ve realised we need a better system for distributing
tasks to the members. Right now you could easily not know what to work. Our
idea is to use Trello for this, but that requires setup and splitting tasks
into even smaller tasks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Resources</b>: We need better resources for training. We&rsquo;ve started asking about
these things. Hopefully we will get an answer next week.

<li>Christoffer: Mostly worked on plan and the specGAN model. Also started a

<li>Eric: I started with training an existing model called WaveRNN where I
managed to generate something that sounds like a flute note. I did the
training on my personal computer at home which is not optimal. We need
better computing resources. I then went on to try a model called MelNet,
which is similar to WaveRNN but it uses melspectograms instead of waveforms
which might be more promising.</li>
<li>Carl: Some work on report; successfully training a WaveNet on sine and
square waves</li>

<li>Cao: Worked on the presentation, reading about GANSynth, trying out
different discriminator/ generator for the simple GAN model that I
implemented last week.</li>
<li>Elias: Spent the first half of the week rewriting the project plan.
Afterwards I primarily worked on getting a 1d convolutional autoencoder
working. I kind of succeeded, but it is very computationally heavy at the

We spent this week working on implementing two kinds of models:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>WaveNet - a raw audio generative model mainly used for speech synthesis</li>
<li>SpecGAN - a model using generative adversarial networks for training by converting audio into spectrographs.</li>

<h3 id="orga25a9ed">Project plan review</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga25a9ed">
<p>
After a meeting with our examiner, there were a fair amount of things that
needed to be changed in the plan.
</p>

<p>
Most of the feedback applies to the entire plan, but here are some key points:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Background</b>: Does not explain or motivate the problem well enough. It is meant to capture the reader but our background lacks a lot of passion required for that.</li>
<li><b>Aim</b>: Same here generally, does not explain why this is an important and interesting field.</li>
<li><b>Timeplan</b>: Does not tell a story, how will we accomplish these things. Try and detail every week and what happens if we discover hurdles. It also has to detail consistent deliveries, ie if the project suddenly had to stop for whatever reason, what do we have to show for our work?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Deadline for the rewritten plan is Wednesday, <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2020-02-26 Wed&gt; </span></span> at 12:00. We
will also try to send it to our supervisor by Monday/Tuesday.

<h3 id="org4c2e8cf">Project so far</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4c2e8cf">
<p>
So far, a lot of work has been going on using colab, a notebook editor in
Google drive. It allows limited access to GPUs which makes it great for
smaller experimentation of models. In the future, we&rsquo;ll want to either pay
for access to GPUs, or try and use Chalmers GPU clusters.

<h4 id="org960ed39">WaveNet</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org960ed39">
<p>
WaveNet requires the amplitudes to be encoded to something that is easier
for the network to work with. This is done using mu<sub>law</sub> encoding, which is
basically just bucketing the amplitudes, but where is gives mode detail to
small amplitudes than large ones.

<h4 id="orgef85c26">SpecGAN</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgef85c26">
<p>
We were originally going to implement GAN-TTS, but because of its
complexity, we decided to implement something simpler first. As mentioned,
most guides on GANs are for images, so it seemed fitting to start with a
model using images (spectrographs).
</p>

<p>
This model requires processing the audio waveform into images using digital
signal processing. This did not have to be done manually, as there are
plenty of libraries to use, but the challenge is to ensure all images of the
entire dataset represent the same thing and have the same format and size.
As such, the data preprocessing has been one of the subtasks for this.
</p>

<p>
The other task is to implement the actual model. There are many guides on
implementing a GAN using the MNIST dataset (dataset consisting of
handwritten letters in image form), but some slight modifications are
required to suit our needs.

<p>
Apparently the expected work amount up to (and including) week 3 was an average of
72 hours (according to mail sent to supervisor). Unless this is an error, that
would mean 24 hours worked per week on average. The information we received
was that it&rsquo;s expected to work 20 hours a week, but that initially that is
hard to achieve. In case it&rsquo;s not an error, we are aware of it but it doesn&rsquo;t
match information we&rsquo;ve gotten earlier.

<h3 id="org375cf1b">Regarding project log feedback</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org375cf1b">
<p>
I appreciate the feedback regarding the project log but want to explain something.
So far, most of the work that has been done is either research (paper and
presentation for group), writing contract/plan or minor implementation.
</p>

<p>
I mention this because so far, there&rsquo;s very little to talk about regarding
individual performance here. We could spend a lot of time detailing
everything done, but that is much better done in the time log above. The
point is, up to this point there has been a lot of shared work.
</p>

<p>
Now that the planning stage is over (which is a very shared job), this part
should be easier to write as more individual tasks will be delegated.

A meeting with chalmers writing was booked, but since that required two groups
to sign up, the meeting never went through. We will try to book another one,
but since the plan now is delivered, getting feedback for it seems unneccesary.
</p>

<p>
On wednesday, the first draft was sent to the supervisor, with feedback
presented to the group on friday morning. The meeting and workshop held on
friday was primarily spent on refining the plan after the feedback received.
All in all, the group is happy with how the plan turned out considering the
project is very open and at a slightly more advanced level than common for
bachelor theses.

The project plan is complete. Some initial trial and error has been
performed, though generating anything close to music is far off. According to
the timeplan, we are now in the phase of generating a musical note using
machine learning.
</p>

<p>
A issue we currently face seems to be storage space. Datasets take a fair
amount of space, yet have to be loaded when training. We&rsquo;re currently waiting
for a reply regarding using Chalmers computing clusters but other options are
available at a price. The canvas page does not specify whether pricing for
such clusters are included in the 3000kr budget (as they don&rsquo;t fall under
components or software), so that will have to be investigated.

<li>Lovisa: Contacted AIVA (AI music company) for info on how their product worked but didn&rsquo;t get much back from them. Also went through tensorflow guides.</li>
<li>Cao: Research autoencoders and attempted implementing and training basic models using Keras and tensorflow</li>
<li><p>
Elias: Made an architecture proposal (shown below), which we will look into more next week.

<h2 id="org550722e">Week 3</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org550722e">
<p>
As per usual, the week began with a meeting on Tuesday followed by a longer
workshop. During the meeting, the members went through what they had worked on
since last friday. For the most part, that was research on tensorflow and a
paper published by Spotify creator group.
</p>

<p>
For the workshop, it was decided that the majority of time
would be spent on writing the project plan. Basic outlining was conducted to
ensure everyone was on the same page regarding the content.
</p>

<p>
On friday, there was a meeting with the supervisor where the group quickly
went through some research notes they had taken from the presentations held
last week. Additionally the focus of this meeting was on the project plan.
There were a fair amount of criticism of the current rough draft.
</p>

<p>
After this meeting, the rest of the day involved a long workshop on writing
the plan according to the criticism received earlier. A lot was changed and
this brought the draft much closer to the final writeup.
</p>

<p>
There is still work to be done on the plan. The deadline is next friday with
the groups&rsquo; deadline being set to Wednesday. Therefore, the next week will
primarily deal with finishing the project plan.

<h3 id="orga654fff">Problems encountered</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga654fff">
<p>
Because the group is not used to writing a research project plan but rather a
product project plan, one of the greatest obstacles have been defining what
will be done. Combined with the wide field, it is difficult to estimate how
much time each task takes.
</p>

<p>
The project task has therefore been simplified a fair bit, but it is still in the
groups ambition to incorporate the more complex features of the project given
that there is available time later on.

<h2 id="org4205461">Week 2</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4205461">
<p>
The week began with a meeting on tuesday, during which a number of points were brought up
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Decide report language and register that on canvas</li>
<li>Began talk about the project report</li>
<li>Discussions on the current writeup of the contract</li>
</ul>

<p>
The meeting was immediately followed by a workshop, where how to efficiently
structure out research was determined. we concluded that the
group would divide into subgroups with the intent of each reading and
summarizing papers. Machine learning is a wide field, beyond basic concepts,
learning everything will take away too much time from the actual project.
</p>

<p>
After a meeting with the supervisor on friday, a research meeting was held.
The idea was to take the subgroups determined earlier and have them present
their findings for the group. This process will be evaluated for future
research meetings, but we felt it was a good start. If anything, the primary
goal of them is to spark discussions, which it was very effective at.
</p>

<p>
Because Cao only returned on thursday, the contract wasn&rsquo;t sent to our
supervisor until Friday evening, after the meeting. The contract is now
considered finished.
</p>

<p>
Though stated in last weeks log that we would begin work on the project plan
this week, small strides were made in that direction. This has a lot to do
with the very open project description. The primary hurdle is to decide on a
goal that is not too easy, but realistic enough to achieve. With such a wide
field and different ways of doing things, we have given that part a bit more time.
</p>

<p>
Next week will be focused on the project plan and another research meeting.

<p>
Since this is the first week of the project, the majority of it has been
discussing the project and reading up on research papers. We started the week
by attending the introductory seminars.
</p>

<p>
During the three meetings, we set up a slack group, had our first meeting with the supervisor and
started writing the group contract.
</p>

<p>
Alone, most of us studied research papers. Since some of the members lacked
experience in the field, Elias set up a notebook intended for teaching the
basics.
</p>

<p>
For personal reasons, Cao was absent for part of the week, but this was notified well in advance.
</p>

<p>
For next week, we are looking to finish the group contract, continue
researching and starting work on the project plan
