We've migrated to a new drive, which means larger storage capacity but also
means the timelog link has been updated to a new link. Our progress will not
be updated on the old link so make sure you check the new one!
</p>

<p>
Also regarding the time log feedback about members not putting in enough
time, due to the IT part of our group having more work to do regarding other
courses, we've opted for them to only work 16h a week until next week. They
will account for this by working 24h later. We also update the time log every
Friday so if a week is missing

<h4 id="orgb3b2ec6">SpecGAN</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb3b2ec6">
<p>
All we've done on specGAN this week is to setup training environment and
checkpointing so that we can train it for a longer period of time.
</p>

<p>
Below are some results of training the model on all kinds of guitar sounds
in the NSynth dataset. Note that this set includes both acoustic and
electric guitar, which sound very different.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="Week 7/result_2020-03-06_12-41-39.gif" alt="result_2020-03-06_12-41-39.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This is a GIF of the training from epoch 0 to epoch ~140. Not much to say other than it looks decent.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="Week 7/image_2020-03-06_12-43-03.png" alt="image_2020-03-06_12-43-03.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
This image show a longer training period, epoch ~640 of a different seed. As you
can see, the spectrograms here resemble the real ones calculated in week 5. I
realised I haven't explained how a spectrogram works:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>X axis is the sample (time in discrete sense)</li>
<li>Y is the frequency, or tone if you will</li>
<li>Color is the magnitude of the short-term fourier transform</li>
</ul>

<p>
The straight horizontal lines indicate a frequency or note was played for a long
time. The reason for many horizontal lines are overtones of the note. These
overtones should be evenly spaced, if we are trying to simulate a note from an
instrument. As you can see, the model has far to go in that regard.
</p>

<p>
Also note the purple part to the right. The sound samples are 4 seconds long,
with 64000 samples each but almost all sounds cut out at around 3.2s. That is
way the purple area exists in each spectrogram.
</p>

<p>
I should also mention that this is trained on the valid set of NSynth, meaning
instead of ~280k samples that the training set has, we are only working with
~12k. This is very bad, but the reason has to do with us not being able to load
in the larger dataset into colab due to some bug that is extremely hard to
troubleshoot. (Input/output error if you are curious). There is very little info
online so either we try solving it on our own (no good error log of it) or we
use other training resources.
</p>

<p>
We also have to work on inverting this; there are a lot of parameters that need
to be specified for this inversion to be done correctly and sound okay.
</p>

<h4 id="org3594a09">New model proposal by Elias</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3594a09">

<p><img src="Week 7/MVIMG_20200306_125637_2020-03-06_13-00-04.jpg" alt="MVIMG_20200306_125637_2020-03-06_13-00-04.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
While SpecGan is good at generating notes, it is not easy to convert an existing note to a latent vector which can be fed to the generator.  This would be useful if we want to train a network to generate melodies as a sequence of latent space vectors.
</p>

<p>
The solution proposed here is to make a hybrid of variational autoencoders and gans, such that crisp images can still be generated, but it also becomes possible to encode them.
</p>

<p>
The idea is to first train a variational autoencoder, and then train a gan to generate realistic images when given the encoding and some noise as input.
In order to ensure that the generated images look similar to the input, the GAN generated image is also encoded, and the generator
gets an additional loss that ensures that the new encoding is similar to the encoding of the original image.

<h4 id="org0af8b9c">Transformer and MIDI</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0af8b9c">
<p>
In the transoformer regard, we are working on getting the MIDI pipeline done
so that we can train the transformers on midi data. The dataset for this is
MAESTRO, which includes both raw audio and MIDI of recordings.
</p>

<p>
MIDI is great at structure, and the goal of the transformers are to get long
term structure. Further ahead in the project, we want to combine note
generation with structure of transformers to hopefully generate music with
details of raw audio and structure of MIDI.
</p>

<p>
So far, there's a lot of research about transformers and how other models
have encoded MIDI for use with machine learning.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Christoffer</b>: Helped with structuring the presentation. Trained a specGAN to
generate nice looking images (lots of bug testing and hyperparameter tuning
in this task). Minor work on transformers (mostly reading about existing

<li><b>Eric</b>: Looked at the MIDI format and created a MIDI encoder function that
can later be used in the dataset preprocessing pipelines. Read about GAN
training techniques like label smoothing. Read about the MIDI format and
created a function to encode MIDI files to a format that can be used to
train a network.</li>
<li><b>Carl</b>: Gave up on wavenet (at least for now), currently working on
preprocessing the MAESTRO dataset)</li>
<li><b>Lovisa</b>: Helped a bit with preparing presentation (along with the rest of
the group), continued work on spectrogram GAN, started working on
transformers with Elias and Christoffer. Mainly tried to get the Music
Transformer by Magenta on github to work, as well as collected some
research relevant to the subject.</li>
<li><b>Cao</b>: Worked on the presentation with the group and presented it with Elias.
Did some light reading about wave2midi2wave.</li>

<p>
Eric managed to generate something loosely sounding like a flute using this
model. Loosely as in it's clearly a wind instrument and it is a recognizable
note with overtones but it still needs some work/training.

Unfortuneately, the results from this model look decent, but sound terrible.
It doesn't quite follow the implementation specGAN used, so that is an area we could improve.

<b>Too ambitions</b>: The project is very ambitious. The workflow of starting on
simple tasks (generating a note etc) and building on those with sprints
remedies that somewhat. Still, we want to spend some time exactly defining
what the end product will be.
</p>

<p>
<b>Better planning</b>: We've realised we need a better system for distributing
tasks to the members. Right now you could easily not know what to work. Our
idea is to use Trello for this, but that requires setup and splitting tasks
into even smaller tasks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Resources</b>: We need better resources for training. We've started asking about
these things. Hopefully we will get an answer next week.

which is similar to WaveRNN but it uses melspectograms instead of waveforms
which might be more promising.</li>
<li>Carl: Some work on report; successfully training a WaveNet on sine and
square waves</li>
<li>Lovisa: Project plan work, as well as some on the specGAN</li>
<li>Cao: Worked on the presentation, reading about GANSynth, trying out
different discriminator/ generator for the simple GAN model that I
implemented last week.</li>
<li>Elias: Spent the first half of the week rewriting the project plan.
Afterwards I primarily worked on getting a 1d convolutional autoencoder
working. I kind of succeeded, but it is very computationally heavy at the
moment and the loss doesn’t really decrease. The output is just noise so
far.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0a7e784">
<p>
We spent this week working on implementing two kinds of models:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>WaveNet - a raw audio generative model mainly used for speech synthesis</li>
<li>SpecGAN - a model using generative adversarial networks for training by converting audio into spectrographs.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The main purpose of this was to generate a note using the NSynth dataset
(dataset consisting of different notes played on different instruments.

<h3 id="org9b0e3a3">Project plan review</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9b0e3a3">
<p>
After a meeting with our examiner, there were a fair amount of things that
needed to be changed in the plan.
</p>

<p>
Most of the feedback applies to the entire plan, but here are some key points:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Background</b>: Does not explain or motivate the problem well enough. It is meant to capture the reader but our background lacks a lot of passion required for that.</li>
<li><b>Aim</b>: Same here generally, does not explain why this is an important and interesting field.</li>
<li><b>Timeplan</b>: Does not tell a story, how will we accomplish these things. Try and detail every week and what happens if we discover hurdles. It also has to detail consistent deliveries, ie if the project suddenly had to stop for whatever reason, what do we have to show for our work?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Deadline for the rewritten plan is Wednesday, <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">&lt;2020-02-26 Wed&gt; </span></span> at 12:00. We
will also try to send it to our supervisor by Monday/Tuesday.

<h3 id="orga51c455">Project so far</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga51c455">
<p>
So far, a lot of work has been going on using colab, a notebook editor in
Google drive. It allows limited access to GPUs which makes it great for
smaller experimentation of models. In the future, we'll want to either pay
for access to GPUs, or try and use Chalmers GPU clusters.

<h4 id="org08079f1">WaveNet</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org08079f1">
<p>
WaveNet requires the amplitudes to be encoded to something that is easier
for the network to work with. This is done using mu<sub>law</sub> encoding, which is
basically just bucketing the amplitudes, but where is gives mode detail to
small amplitudes than large ones.

<h4 id="org9b302ce">SpecGAN</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9b302ce">
<p>
We were originally going to implement GAN-TTS, but because of its
complexity, we decided to implement something simpler first. As mentioned,
most guides on GANs are for images, so it seemed fitting to start with a
model using images (spectrographs).

<p>
This model requires processing the audio waveform into images using digital
signal processing. This did not have to be done manually, as there are
plenty of libraries to use, but the challenge is to ensure all images of the
entire dataset represent the same thing and have the same format and size.
As such, the data preprocessing has been one of the subtasks for this.
</p>

<p>
The other task is to implement the actual model. There are many guides on
implementing a GAN using the MNIST dataset (dataset consisting of
handwritten letters in image form), but some slight modifications are
required to suit our needs.

<h3 id="orgf74b073">Time log warning</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf74b073">
<p>
Apparently the expected work amount up to (and including) week 3 was an average of
72 hours (according to mail sent to supervisor). Unless this is an error, that
would mean 24 hours worked per week on average. The information we received
was that it's expected to work 20 hours a week, but that initially that is
hard to achieve. In case it's not an error, we are aware of it but it doesn't
match information we've gotten earlier.

<h3 id="org6d14163">Regarding project log feedback</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6d14163">
<p>
I appreciate the feedback regarding the project log but want to explain something.
So far, most of the work that has been done is either research (paper and
presentation for group), writing contract/plan or minor implementation.
</p>

<p>
I mention this because so far, there's very little to talk about regarding
individual performance here. We could spend a lot of time detailing
everything done, but that is much better done in the time log above. The
point is, up to this point there has been a lot of shared work.
</p>

<p>
Now that the planning stage is over (which is a very shared job), this part
should be easier to write as more individual tasks will be delegated.

<h3 id="orgf92b9cb">Meetings and workshops</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf92b9cb">
<p>
A meeting with chalmers writing was booked, but since that required two groups
to sign up, the meeting never went through. We will try to book another one,
but since the plan now is delivered, getting feedback for it seems unneccesary.
</p>

<p>
On wednesday, the first draft was sent to the supervisor, with feedback
presented to the group on friday morning. The meeting and workshop held on
friday was primarily spent on refining the plan after the feedback received.
All in all, the group is happy with how the plan turned out considering the
project is very open and at a slightly more advanced level than common for
bachelor theses.

<p>
The project plan is complete. Some initial trial and error has been
performed, though generating anything close to music is far off. According to
the timeplan, we are now in the phase of generating a musical note using
machine learning.
</p>

<p>
A issue we currently face seems to be storage space. Datasets take a fair
amount of space, yet have to be loaded when training. We're currently waiting
for a reply regarding using Chalmers computing clusters but other options are
available at a price. The canvas page does not specify whether pricing for
such clusters are included in the 3000kr budget (as they don't fall under
components or software), so that will have to be investigated.

We will use this section to detail problemsolving/tasks delegated to members.
Besides everyone working on the project plan, here are some tasks solved by each member
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Christoffer: So far been tasked with documentation, project log writing and generally being the secretary. Otherwise been learning tensorflow</li>
<li>Eric: Took on the challenge of creating a gantt chart, which he completed by
writing his own javascript script. Also have been very active in initial
development and testing of ideas using google colab.</li>
<li>Carl: Ensured our latex documents have proper systems for commenting and change requesting, which helped writing the plan immensely.</li>
<li>Lovisa: Contacted AIVA (AI music company) for info on how their product worked but didn't get much back from them. Also went through tensorflow guides.</li>
<li>Cao: Research autoencoders and attempted implementing and training basic models using Keras and tensorflow</li>
<li><p>
Elias: Made an architecture proposal (shown below), which we will look into more next week.

<h2 id="org1be2e93">Week 3</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1be2e93">
<p>
As per usual, the week began with a meeting on Tuesday followed by a longer
workshop. During the meeting, the members went through what they had worked on
since last friday. For the most part, that was research on tensorflow and a
paper published by Spotify creator group.
</p>

<p>
For the workshop, it was decided that the majority of time
would be spent on writing the project plan. Basic outlining was conducted to
ensure everyone was on the same page regarding the content.
</p>

<p>
On friday, there was a meeting with the supervisor where the group quickly
went through some research notes they had taken from the presentations held
last week. Additionally the focus of this meeting was on the project plan.
There were a fair amount of criticism of the current rough draft.
</p>

<p>
After this meeting, the rest of the day involved a long workshop on writing
the plan according to the criticism received earlier. A lot was changed and
this brought the draft much closer to the final writeup.
</p>

<p>
There is still work to be done on the plan. The deadline is next friday with
the groups' deadline being set to Wednesday. Therefore, the next week will
primarily deal with finishing the project plan.

<div id="outline-container-org57cf7ed" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org57cf7ed">Problems encountered</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org57cf7ed">
<p>
Because the group is not used to writing a research project plan but rather a
product project plan, one of the greatest obstacles have been defining what
will be done. Combined with the wide field, it is difficult to estimate how
much time each task takes.
</p>

<p>
The project task has therefore been simplified a fair bit, but it is still in the
groups ambition to incorporate the more complex features of the project given
that there is available time later on.

<div id="outline-container-org5d82597" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5d82597">Week 2</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5d82597">
<p>
The week began with a meeting on tuesday, during which a number of points were brought up
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Decide report language and register that on canvas</li>
<li>Began talk about the project report</li>
<li>Discussions on the current writeup of the contract</li>
</ul>

<p>
The meeting was immediately followed by a workshop, where how to efficiently
structure out research was determined. we concluded that the
group would divide into subgroups with the intent of each reading and
summarizing papers. Machine learning is a wide field, beyond basic concepts,
learning everything will take away too much time from the actual project.
</p>

<p>
After a meeting with the supervisor on friday, a research meeting was held.
The idea was to take the subgroups determined earlier and have them present
their findings for the group. This process will be evaluated for future
research meetings, but we felt it was a good start. If anything, the primary
goal of them is to spark discussions, which it was very effective at.
</p>

<p>
Because Cao only returned on thursday, the contract wasn't sent to our
supervisor until Friday evening, after the meeting. The contract is now
considered finished.
</p>

<p>
Though stated in last weeks log that we would begin work on the project plan
this week, small strides were made in that direction. This has a lot to do
with the very open project description. The primary hurdle is to decide on a
goal that is not too easy, but realistic enough to achieve. With such a wide
field and different ways of doing things, we have given that part a bit more time.
</p>

<p>
Next week will be focused on the project plan and another research meeting.

<h2 id="org09e60f9">Week 1</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org09e60f9">
<p>
Since this is the first week of the project, the majority of it has been
discussing the project and reading up on research papers. We started the week
by attending the introductory seminars.
</p>

<p>
During the three meetings, we set up a slack group, had our first meeting with the supervisor and
started writing the group contract.
</p>

<p>
Alone, most of us studied research papers. Since some of the members lacked
experience in the field, Elias set up a notebook intended for teaching the
basics.
</p>

<p>
For personal reasons, Cao was absent for part of the week, but this was notified well in advance.
</p>

<p>
For next week, we are looking to finish the group contract, continue researching and starting work on the project plan.
